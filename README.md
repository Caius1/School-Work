# School-Work
A repository to showcase projects and assignments that I have done during my university courses.

"Olio-ohjelmoinnin harjoitustyo" directory contains the practice work that I made at the end of object-oriented programming course.
It is a small maze game that runs in cmd-window. It is written in java and the main file is located in Oope2016HT/Oope2016HT.java.
